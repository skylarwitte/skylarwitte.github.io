    "section": "",
    "text": "The Professional Bull Riders (PBR) season of 2023 featured hundreds of rides and dozens of talented athletes. But out of all the riders, who had the best overall season?\nThe complicated part about ranking PBR riders is that there are so many stats you have to consider. Just because a rider wins the PBR World Finals, it doesn’t necessarily mean they had the best season out of all other riders. Maybe they just had a good day. To find out this answer, there are three main stats we can look at: consistency, total success, and ride quality. Let’s look at these metrics to see not only who held on the longest while riding, but who scored the best overall.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.2\n✔ ggplot2   4.0.0     ✔ tibble    3.3.0\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.1.0     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nrider &lt;- read_csv(\"data/BullRiders_PBR_TPD_2023.csv\") |&gt;\n  filter(Rides &gt; 3)\n\n\nRows: 357 Columns: 16\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (1): Rider\ndbl (15): Points, Points Back, Events, Outs, Rides, Buckoffs, prop.Ridden, A...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nCode\nrider |&gt;\n  select(Rider, prop.Ridden) |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    prop.Ridden = \"Ride Percentage\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Who had the best ride percentage of the 2023 season?\",\n    subtitle = \"Josh Frost was miles ahead of all other riders with a perfect ride percentage, while Elizmar Jeremias had the worst ride percentage of 30.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Skylar Witte  |  **Source:** SCORE Sports Data Repository: Professional Bull Riding Analysis\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n  ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"green\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"black\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Rider == \"Josh Frost\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"red\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"black\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Rider == \"Elizmar Jeremias\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho had the best ride percentage of the 2023 season?\n\n\nJosh Frost was miles ahead of all other riders with a perfect ride percentage, while Elizmar Jeremias had the worst ride percentage of 30.\n\n\nRider\nRide Percentage\n\n\n\n\nJosh Frost\n100.00\n\n\nAlex Cerqueira\n60.00\n\n\nJoão Ricardo Vieira\n57.14\n\n\nAlvaro Ariel\n33.33\n\n\nEdnélio Almeida\n66.67\n\n\nCassio Dias\n38.46\n\n\nDawson Branton\n50.00\n\n\nElizmar Jeremias\n30.00\n\n\nGarrett Jones\n41.67\n\n\nWingson Henrique da Silva\n50.00\n\n\nWyatt Rogers\n50.00\n\n\nElijah Mora\n40.00\n\n\nCole Skender\n60.00\n\n\nJunio Quaresima\n44.44\n\n\n\nBy: Skylar Witte | Source: SCORE Sports Data Repository: Professional Bull Riding Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most important stats to look at when deciding a rider’s success is their ride percentage. Here, we can see how often each rider successfully completed their ride. How a rider completes a ride is by last the full eight seconds.\nRiders with a higher ride percentage are the most consistant, and when looking at the table, Josh Frost was miles ahead of other riders with a perfect ride percentage. This shows that every time Frost hopped on a bull, he made it to the bell every time. Elizmar Jeremias struggled this season with holding on, as he was the least consistent throughout the season at 30%.\n\n\nCode\nalex &lt;- rider |&gt; \n  filter(Rider\n  %in% c(\"Alex Cerqueira\"))\n\njosh &lt;- rider |&gt;\n  filter(Rider\n  %in% c(\"Josh Frost\"))\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=rider, aes (x=reorder(Rider, Rides), weight=Rides), fill=\"lightgrey\") + \n  geom_bar(data=alex, aes (x=reorder(Rider, Rides), weight= Rides),  fill=\"red\") +\ngeom_bar(data=josh, aes (x=reorder(Rider, Rides), weight= Rides),  fill=\"green\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Qualifying Rides\", \n    title=\"Who had the most successful rides during the 2023 PBR season.\", \n    subtitle=\"Alex Cerqueira may not have had the best riding percentage, but he had the most 8-second rides during the season.\", \n    caption=\"Source: PBR | Skylar Witte\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\ntheme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n   plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n   plot.subtitle = element_text(size=5), \n   axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent from the last table, here we are looking at total qualifying rides. And as we can see, Frost is not at the top of the list. Alex Cerqueira had the highest number of rides.\nThis may be confusing, but let me explain. This is possible because you can stand out in number of qualified rides even if you don’t in consistency. Some people ride more bulls. And Cerqueira must have rode more bulls than Frost, but he didn’t stay on as many as Frost did. Frost rode the full eight seconds on every bull he rode, while Cerqueira had more rides but didn’t last to the bell. When we look at the graph, Frost was still ranked third overall.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=rider, \n    aes(x=prop.Ridden, y=`Avg Ride Score`, size=Rides),\n    color=\"grey\",\n    alpha = .6) + \ngeom_point(\n    data=josh, \n    aes(x=prop.Ridden, y=`Avg Ride Score`, size=Rides),\n    color=\"green\") +\n    geom_text_repel(\n    data=rider, \n    aes(x=prop.Ridden, y=`Avg Ride Score`, label=Rider)\n  ) + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Ride Success Percentage\", \n    y=\"Average Ride Score\", \n    title=\"PBR 2023 riders ranked by consistency and ride quality.\", \n    subtitle=\"Josh Frost stands out as the season's top rider with perfect ride consistency, strong average scores, and a high number of qualified rides.\", \n    caption=\"Source: PBR | Skylar Witte\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=5), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn our bubble chart, we combine everything we have looked at so far, as well as adding on each rider’s average ride score. Average ride score tells us how skillful and effective each rider’s qualified ride was. This is taken from the judge’s final score of the rider, which includes technique, difficulty and style. So to summarize, this is pretty much the most important statistic in bull riding.\nAnd there is Josh Frost. He was in a league of his own this season. Not only did he have the best ride percentage, he also has a very strong average ride score and a good amount of rides. This final graph proves to us that Josh Frost was the best overall rider of the PBR 2023 season, with perfect consistency, strong average scores, and a good number of rides."

    "text": "Typically when you think of bull riding, you think of the rider. After all, that’s who’s competing and winning all the money, so what else would you focus on?\nMany tend to forget that the second half of the points system and sport entirely is the bull itself. So, for this post, I will be analyzing which bulls had the strongest overall performances in the 2023 PBR Pro Division Tour using scoring, difficulty, and buck off characteristics. Here, we will identify the bulls that consistently challenged riders and produced the highest-quality trips.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.2\n✔ ggplot2   4.0.0     ✔ tibble    3.3.0\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.1.0     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\n\n\nRegistered S3 methods overwritten by 'ggalt':\n  method                  from   \n  grobHeight.absoluteGrob ggplot2\n  grobWidth.absoluteGrob  ggplot2\n  grobX.absoluteGrob      ggplot2\n  grobY.absoluteGrob      ggplot2\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\n\n\nbulls &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Bulls_PBR_TPD_2023.csv\")\n\n\nRows: 50 Columns: 11\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (1): Bull\ndbl (10): World Champ Avg Score, Events, Ridden, Outs, Rides, Buckoffs, Avg ...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nCode\ntopbulls &lt;- bulls |&gt; \n  filter(Bull\n    %in% c(\"Shameless\", \n          \"Juicy\", \n         \"John 14:6\", \n         \"Hard Rock\", \n          \"Ground Assault\",\n         \"Flapjack\",\n         \"Big Pokey\")\n  )\n  \nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=bulls, aes (x=reorder(Bull, Buckoffs), weight=Buckoffs), fill=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=topbulls, aes (x=reorder(Bull, Buckoffs), weight=Buckoffs), fill=\"red\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Total Buckoffs\", \n    title=\"Which Bull Shut Riders Down the Most\", \n    subtitle=\"Out of all the bulls that participated in the 2023 Pro Tour Division, only seven had more than one buckoff.\n    These bulls were the most difficult to ride in the 2023 season.\", \n    caption=\"Source: PBR | Skylar Witte\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\ntheme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n   plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n   plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n   axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor my first graph, I wanted to see which bulls were at the top. By “top” I mean who was the hardest to ride. To show this, I looked into how many buck offs each bull had. Buck offs measure how many riders a bull has bucked off. The higher the buck off total, the more difficult and dominant the bull is.\nIn the bar chart, there are only seven bulls out of the entire season that had more than one buck off: Shameless, Juicy, John 14:6, Hard Rock, Group Assault, Flapjack and Big Pokey. That may seem like a lot, but this is seven of 50 bulls that competed. These seven got riders off the quickest, putting them at the top of our list.\nNow that we know what bulls are the most difficult to ride, let’s move to which of these bulls have the best quality of ride.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=bulls, \n    aes(x=`Avg BullScore`, y=`Avg Buckoff Time`, size=Outs),\n    color=\"grey\",\n    alpha = .6) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=topbulls, \n    aes(x=`Avg BullScore`, y=`Avg Buckoff Time`, size=Outs), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 44.645) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 3.222) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=topbulls, \n    aes(x=`Avg BullScore`, y=`Avg Buckoff Time`, label=Bull)\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Average Bull Score\", \n    y=\"Average Buckoff Time\", \n    title=\"Bull Performance by Power, Buckoff Time, and Workload\", \n    subtitle=\"Here we compare average bull score and buckoff time, highlighting the bulls with the \n    most buckoffs from the last graph. Bulls like Hard Rock and Juicy are where you want to be, as they \n    combine high power with strong scoring potential.\", \n    caption=\"Source: PBR | Skylar Witte\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 17, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 15), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this bubble chart, I looked into both the average bull score and average buck off time of each bull. The average score shows how judges rated the bull’s athleticism and power, while the average time shows how long riders were able to hold on before taking the fall. The bubble sizes are to show outs, which are the same buck offs.\nWhen looking at the chart, you may want to say that the data in the top-right quadrant is the most important. But I beg to differ. Those data points only have one out connected to them. The ones that are more important are the ones with the larger bubbles, meaning they had more buck offs. So knowing this, Hard Rock and Juicy would be in the running for top bull across these dimensions.\n\n\nCode\nhardrock &lt;- bulls |&gt;\n  filter(Bull == \"Hard Rock\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=topbulls, aes(x=`Avg Buckoff Time`, y=`Avg BullScore`)) +\n  geom_point(data=hardrock, aes(x=`Avg Buckoff Time`, y=`Avg BullScore`),\n             color=\"red\") +\n  geom_smooth(data=bulls, aes(x=`Avg Buckoff Time`, y=`Avg BullScore`), method=\"lm\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Average Buckoff Time\", \n    y=\"Average Bull Score\", \n    title=\"How Buckoff Time Relates to Bull Power\", \n    subtitle=\"This scatterplot compares each bull’s average bull score with the average amount of time riders stayed on. Based on this chart, Hard Rock, who is highlighted, stands out as the best bull because it pairs one of the highest average scores with solid buckoff times, showing both power and consistency.\", caption=\"Source: PBR | Skylar Witte\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 17, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 15), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'"
