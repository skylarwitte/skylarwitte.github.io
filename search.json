    "text": "The Professional Bull Riders (PBR) season of 2023 featured hundreds of rides and dozens of talented athletes. But out of all the riders, who had the best overall season?\nThe complicated part about ranking PBR riders is that there are so many stats you have to consider. Just because a rider wins the PBR World Finals, it doesn’t necessarily mean they had the best season out of all other riders. Maybe they just had a good day. To find out this answer, there are three main stats we can look at: consistency, total success, and ride quality. Let’s look at these metrics to see not only who held on the longest while riding, but who scored the best overall.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.2\n✔ ggplot2   4.0.0     ✔ tibble    3.3.0\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.1.0     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nrider &lt;- read_csv(\"data/BullRiders_PBR_TPD_2023.csv\") |&gt;\n  filter(Rides &gt; 3)\n\n\nRows: 357 Columns: 16\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (1): Rider\ndbl (15): Points, Points Back, Events, Outs, Rides, Buckoffs, prop.Ridden, A...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nCode\nrider |&gt;\n  select(Rider, prop.Ridden) |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    prop.Ridden = \"Ride Percentage\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Who had the best ride percentage of the 2023 season?\",\n    subtitle = \"Josh Frost was miles ahead of all other riders with a perfect ride percentage, while Elizmar Jeremias had the worst ride percentage of 30.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Skylar Witte  |  **Source:** SCORE Sports Data Repository: Professional Bull Riding Analysis\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n  ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"green\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"black\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Rider == \"Josh Frost\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"red\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"black\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Rider == \"Elizmar Jeremias\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho had the best ride percentage of the 2023 season?\n\n\nJosh Frost was miles ahead of all other riders with a perfect ride percentage, while Elizmar Jeremias had the worst ride percentage of 30.\n\n\nRider\nRide Percentage\n\n\n\n\nJosh Frost\n100.00\n\n\nAlex Cerqueira\n60.00\n\n\nJoão Ricardo Vieira\n57.14\n\n\nAlvaro Ariel\n33.33\n\n\nEdnélio Almeida\n66.67\n\n\nCassio Dias\n38.46\n\n\nDawson Branton\n50.00\n\n\nElizmar Jeremias\n30.00\n\n\nGarrett Jones\n41.67\n\n\nWingson Henrique da Silva\n50.00\n\n\nWyatt Rogers\n50.00\n\n\nElijah Mora\n40.00\n\n\nCole Skender\n60.00\n\n\nJunio Quaresima\n44.44\n\n\n\nBy: Skylar Witte | Source: SCORE Sports Data Repository: Professional Bull Riding Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most important stats to look at when deciding a rider’s success is their ride percentage. Here, we can see how often each rider successfully completed their ride. How a rider completes a ride is by last the full eight seconds.\nRiders with a higher ride percentage are the most consistant, and when looking at the table, Josh Frost was miles ahead of other riders with a perfect ride percentage. This shows that every time Frost hopped on a bull, he made it to the bell every time. Elizmar Jeremias struggled this season with holding on, as he was the least consistent throughout the season at 30%.\n\n\nCode\nalex &lt;- rider |&gt; \n  filter(Rider\n  %in% c(\"Alex Cerqueira\"))\n\njosh &lt;- rider |&gt;\n  filter(Rider\n  %in% c(\"Josh Frost\"))\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=rider, aes (x=reorder(Rider, Rides), weight=Rides), fill=\"lightgrey\") + \n  geom_bar(data=alex, aes (x=reorder(Rider, Rides), weight= Rides),  fill=\"red\") +\ngeom_bar(data=josh, aes (x=reorder(Rider, Rides), weight= Rides),  fill=\"green\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Qualifying Rides\", \n    title=\"Who had the most successful rides during the 2023 PBR season.\", \n    subtitle=\"Alex Cerqueira may not have had the best riding percentage, but he had the most 8-second rides during the season.\", \n    caption=\"Source: PBR | Skylar Witte\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\ntheme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n   plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n   plot.subtitle = element_text(size=5), \n   axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent from the last table, here we are looking at total qualifying rides. And as we can see, Frost is not at the top of the list. Alex Cerqueira had the highest number of rides.\nThis may be confusing, but let me explain. This is possible because you can stand out in number of qualified rides even if you don’t in consistency. Some people ride more bulls. And Cerqueira must have rode more bulls than Frost, but he didn’t stay on as many as Frost did. Frost rode the full eight seconds on every bull he rode, while Cerqueira had more rides but didn’t last to the bell. When we look at the graph, Frost was still ranked third overall.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=rider, \n    aes(x=prop.Ridden, y=`Avg Ride Score`, size=Rides),\n    color=\"grey\",\n    alpha = .6) + \ngeom_point(\n    data=josh, \n    aes(x=prop.Ridden, y=`Avg Ride Score`, size=Rides),\n    color=\"green\") +\n    geom_text_repel(\n    data=rider, \n    aes(x=prop.Ridden, y=`Avg Ride Score`, label=Rider)\n  ) + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Ride Success Percentage\", \n    y=\"Average Ride Score\", \n    title=\"PBR 2023 riders ranked by consistency and ride quality.\", \n    subtitle=\"Josh Frost stands out as the season's top rider with perfect ride consistency, strong average scores, and a high number of qualified rides.\", \n    caption=\"Source: PBR | Skylar Witte\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=5), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn our bubble chart, we combine everything we have looked at so far, as well as adding on each rider’s average ride score. Average ride score tells us how skillful and effective each rider’s qualified ride was. This is taken from the judge’s final score of the rider, which includes technique, difficulty and style. So to summarize, this is pretty much the most important statistic in bull riding.\nAnd there is Josh Frost. He was in a league of his own this season. Not only did he have the best ride percentage, he also has a very strong average ride score and a good amount of rides. This final graph proves to us that Josh Frost was the best overall rider of the PBR 2023 season, with perfect consistency, strong average scores, and a good number of rides."
